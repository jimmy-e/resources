## A few ways of many ways to improve your skills

* Watch lots of youtube videos from great content creators. It's an easy way to make sure you 
  are always learning something from engineers who are more experienced and better skilled than 
  you are, especially if you don't have that opportunity to be mentored on your job. The more 
  videos you watch, the more your algorithm in YouTube will change to give you more and more 
  great engineering content.
